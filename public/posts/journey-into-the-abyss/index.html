        <h3 id="unveiling-the-cosmic-abyss" class="relative group">Unveiling the Cosmic Abyss </h3><p>Have you ever wondered what lies beyond the veil of the universe? Hidden in the depths of space, a mind-boggling phenomenon awaits: The Black Hole. Join me on a thrilling journey as we unravel the secrets of these enigmatic cosmic entities. Get ready for an adventure that defies the laws of physics and challenges the boundaries of our understanding.</p>
<h3 id="birth-of-darkness-the-stellar-collapse" class="relative group">Birth of Darkness: The Stellar Collapse </h3><p>Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning. Imagine a massive and awe-inspiring star reaching a critical point in its existence. This momentous event triggers an extraordinary chain reaction known as a supernova. As the star collapses upon itself, it leaves behind a dark void shrouded in mystery. This void is a black hole—an entity with a gravitational force so intense that not even light can escape its grasp.</p>

<h3 id="the-chandrasekhar-limit-a-cosmic-threshold" class="relative group">The Chandrasekhar Limit: A Cosmic Threshold </h3><p>But how does a star transform into this cosmic abyss? Enter the Chandrasekhar limit, a crucial concept in understanding black hole formation. In 1930, the brilliant astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar proposed that any star surpassing 1.39 times the mass of our sun would inevitably collapse into a black hole. To put this into perspective, that&rsquo;s equivalent to a staggering 2765 trillion trillion tons, or 2.765 x 10<sup>30</sup> kilograms.</p>
<h3 id="stellar-and-supermassive-two-faces-of-darkness" class="relative group">Stellar and Supermassive: Two Faces of Darkness </h3><p>As the universe dances through its cosmic symphony, black holes take on different roles. Stellar black holes, formed from the remnants of dying stars, wander the galaxy, stealthily devouring everything in their path. On the other hand, supermassive black holes emerge at the very heart of galaxies, coexisting and evolving alongside their cosmic hosts since the galaxies&rsquo; inception.</p>
<h3 id="unveiling-the-abyss-components-of-a-black-hole" class="relative group">Unveiling the Abyss: Components of a Black Hole </h3><p>Now, let&rsquo;s delve deeper into the abyss and examine the components that define a black hole&rsquo;s existence.
<strong>The Event Horizon</strong>: Beyond the Point of No Return Imagine an invisible boundary, a cosmic Rubicon that marks the point of no return. This boundary, known as the event horizon, serves as the black hole&rsquo;s threshold. Once an object crosses this threshold, escape becomes impossible. The escape velocity surpasses even the speed of light, trapping all matter within its gravitational embrace.
<strong>The Singularity</strong>: Where Physics Ceases to Exist. Venture further into the heart of a black hole, and you&rsquo;ll encounter the singularity—a one-dimensional point within the fabric of space-time. Here, gravity becomes infinitely intense, warping the laws of physics beyond comprehension. At the singularity, the very essence of reality disintegrates, leaving us in awe of the mysteries that lie within.</p>

<h3 id="the-elusive-shadows-unmasking-black-holes" class="relative group">The Elusive Shadows: Unmasking Black Holes </h3><p>Detecting the presence of a black hole proves a formidable challenge, even for the most advanced equipment. Yet, there are tantalizing ways to catch a glimpse of these cosmic enigmas.
The Curvature of Light: Light, as it travels through the cosmos, follows a path dictated by gravity. Albert Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity predicted this curvature, a concept that forever changed our understanding of the universe. In 1919, during a total solar eclipse, Arthur Eddington and his team provided groundbreaking evidence for this theory. By observing the bending of light from the Hyades star cluster as it passed close to the sun, they confirmed Einstein&rsquo;s predictions and thrust the theory of relativity into the scientific spotlight.</p>
<h3 id="the-abyss-beckons-approaching-the-event-horizon" class="relative group">The Abyss Beckons: Approaching the Event Horizon </h3><p>As we approach the edge of a black hole, a cosmic ballet of light and darkness unfolds. Here, the laws of physics conspire to challenge our intuition and bend the boundaries of possibility. The Perilous Journey: Imagine hovering just outside the event horizon, a precarious position between existence and oblivion. If you could shine a light on your face in this treacherous place, you would be astounded to witness your own back, as light bends around the black hole, taking a circular orbit. However, beware, for the closer you come to the black hole&rsquo;s event horizon, the faster you must accelerate to resist its relentless pull.
Spaghettification: A Gruesome Fate- Enter the event horizon, and your fate is sealed. The forces at play within a black hole give rise to a terrifying phenomenon known as spaghettification. As gravity stretches your body into an elongated shape, much like strands of spaghetti, you would succumb to a grisly demise. Torn apart at an atomic level, the consequences of this cosmic encounter would be nothing short of horrifying.</p>
<h3 id="darkness-beckons-the-final-journey" class="relative group">Darkness Beckons: The Final Journey </h3><p>The Descent into Oblivion: A Journey without Return: If you find yourself hurtling toward the dark abyss, know this: once you cross the event horizon, there is no turning back. Beyond this point, the rules of the universe are forever altered, and any transmission or signal from within the black hole will be lost to eternity. You will venture into a realm where nothing escapes, lost in the annals of cosmic history.</p>

<h3 id="the-ultimate-enigma" class="relative group">The Ultimate Enigma </h3><p>Black holes, these cosmic behemoths, continue to captivate and mystify us. They hold secrets that challenge our very understanding of the universe. As we strive to unlock their mysteries, we must also remember the awe-inspiring dangers they present. To encounter a black hole unawares is to face the epitome of darkness, where even light ceases to exist.
So, should you ever find yourself confronted by the immense shadow of a black hole, take heed. Respect its power, maintain a safe distance, and marvel at the immense forces that shape our universe. For to cross that threshold is to surrender to the whims of a cosmic abyss, a place where existence and the laws of nature vanish into the infinite void.</p>

### What is a black hole?
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.
<img src="/image/posts/black-hole.webp" class="h-64 mx-auto rounded-md">

### How is it formed?
Any star reaching beyond a certain point in its mass (aka the Schwarzschild Radius) would collapse in on itself causing a large explosion known as a supernova. What remains of this explosion is a small dark void which exerts a gravitational force so intense that not even light can escape. This is because light travels at a speed of 299,792,458 kilometres per second and nothing can travel faster than light as predicted by the General Theory of relativity.  This phenomenon is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, named after the Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who proposed it in 1930. The presently accepted value of this limit is 1.39 solar masses(1.39 times the mass of our sun. So, if a star was 1.39 times as massive as our sun, it would form a black hole). This would amount to a whopping 2.765 x 10<sup>30</sup> kg (2765 trillion trillion tons). These Stellar black holes roam around in the galaxy, eating up stars. Black holes formed from dying stars are known as **Stellar Black Holes**. **Supermassive black holes**, on the other hand, are formed at galactic centres and are born with the host galaxy itself. 

### What are the components of a black hole?
* An *event horizon* is the boundary of a black hole. It is not a physical surface but is the point of no return. In other words, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light from this point. 
* At the centre of a black hole, space-time becomes a one-dimensional point which contains a huge amount of mass. As a result, gravity becomes infinite and space-time curves infinitely, the laws of physics as we know them cease to exist. This point of space-time is known as a *singularity*.

You should appreciate the hazards of encountering a black hole unawares. Just darkness against darkness. It is highly impossible to detect the presence of a black hole without any specialised equipment. You may well not realize the threat before your fate is sealed. To detect a black hole visually, the only solution is to carry a very powerful source of light, which shows the unilluminated disc of the black hole. 

Light as all other forms of electromagnetic radiation must travel in some path. Sitting on your couch, if you shine a flashlight at a wall, the beam of light appears to be straight. However, it is not perfectly straight. This is because Earth has a relatively low mass and so the bend imparted by Earth's gravity on the beam of light is more subtle and difficult to detect.

The bending of light was the first test of general relativity, predicted by Einstein. Headed by Arthur Eddington, a group of scientists travelled to South Africa on 29th May 1919 barely 6 months after World-War 2. Due to the total solar eclipse, the moon obstructed the sun allowing faint light from the Hyades star cluster to fall into Eddington’s telescopes. But at the time of the eclipse, Hyades was positioned directly behind the Sun from our perspective. 

If light travelled along straight lines, none of the luminosity from Hyades should have made it to the Earth. The cluster would spray its rays in all directions, and those headed toward the Earth would fall into the Sun. If light travelled along the curved paths predicted by relativity, then the Sun would act as a lens and bend an image of Hyades our way. Eddington's findings made the headlines of many newspapers, catapulting Einstein's fame. The general theory of relativity is heralded as one of the greatest achievements of humanity to this day. 

Right outside every black hole, there is a curve in space so sharp that light can fall around the hole in a circular orbit. So in theory, if you could jet-pack to that specific location, (don't forget to fire all engines so you don't fall into the black hole) and shine a light on your face, you would be able to see your own back. As you get closer to the black hole, your free fall will be faster. 

You would need a considerable amount of fuel to escape the pulling force. The escape velocity of any object is the velocity required to overcome the gravitational pull of that object. For comparison, any rocket should attain a velocity of at least 11km/s to escape the gravitational pull of the Earth. Similarly, the escape velocity of the moon is 2.5 km/s and the escape velocity of the Sun is a staggering 600 km/s! 

The nearer you approach the hole, the faster you need to accelerate to resist from falling. In the emptiness that surrounds a black hole, you can get closer and closer to the hole without knowing its proximity. However, after you cross the event horizon, no matter how hard you try, your attempt will be futile and you will plunge into the hole irrevocably.

Anything that crosses the event horizon is forever lost to the world outside. From the outside, the black hole is dark. It is black. It’s a black hole. If you were to fall through that shadow, you’d find no physical, material surface. You’d spectacularly plummet in the dark emptiness.

Should the choice arise, you are advised to fall into the biggest black hole possible.  If you are very small compared to the black hole, you will hardly notice that the horizon is curved, like you hardly notice that the Earth’s surface is curved. If you stood on a basketball, the curvature under your feet is more noticeable than the curvature of the entire Earth. 
You’d find yourself compromised if the hole was so small that your feet fall across the horizon along their own path that diverges from that of your head. Your tissue would resist the pull and eventually, your entire body would literally be torn apart and the consequences would be pretty gruesome. This process is termed as the famous Spaghettification effect as your body would be torn apart like spaghetti. 

Your damnation in a black hole takes a microsecond. You could prolong your life expectancy by a year or two by choosing a black hole trillions of times more massive than the sun. However, you would have to spend the entire time swirling inside the black hole reflecting on all the bad choices you made in your life. You may not want to prolong your demise if you cannot tolerate the existential dread, the gnawing suspicions, the cogent predictions about your unstoppable departure from this world.


If you find yourself approaching an utterly dark shadow, visible only in contrast to a bright background of light, beware. Avoid at all costs. Maintain a safe distance. If you get too close you will need all the fuel in the universe to escape, and that will not be enough. It will be hard to assess if the shadow is small and nearby or big and far away. If you do cross the shadow, you will be the first human to be dismembered by spacetime and obliterated near the infamous singularity, prophesized to be an actual hole in the centre of the black hole, a tear in the fabric of spacetime that leads nowhere.

Take solace in knowing that all the observation you make will be yours alone. None of your transmissions will make it out of the hole to Earth. All documentation of your demise will follow you into oblivion.

So in essence, there is no way to actually 'survive' a black hole. All we can do is keep our distance from them, and hope that we never run into any one of them. -->
